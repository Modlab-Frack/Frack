Key	option 1	option 2	option 3	Event Description
1	Hire scientists at near university to produce false data about emissions.	Keep calm and DO Nothing	Set up meeting with head investigator to talk out "issues in record emissions"	Environmental Working Group (EWG) has decided to investigate the credibility of EPA record of emissions from Fracking wells in Texas. (You happen to also own 75 of the wells in the state.)
2	Remove all carcinogenic ingredients	Refuse to disclose ingredients and health hazards associated with those chemicals	Replace that one ingredient brought up	The use of dimethyl formaldehyde listed as a constituent of fracking fluid has raised health concerns. This ingredient has not only been known as an irritant to skin and eyes, but has been found in ground water. Long term effects include failure kidneys and liver.
3	Invest on research to effectively seal any leakage coming from fracking sites	Propose a hefty settlement to those who are affected	Close down your fracking operations in the area but don't mention you are responsible for the environmental effects. 	Hazardous, carcinogenic and non-biodegradable materials are used by your company's drilling process for natural gas. Knowingly, your extraction methods do not fully prevent natural gas from seeping out through the earth's surface and or under and through ground water layer. This has been proven on numerous accounts of residents who live in close proximity to your fracking wells in several states and more than 80 of them are experiencing degraded air quality and obvious signs of water pollution.
4	Give a general statement saying that your fracking operations doesn't use any harmful chemicals for extractions	Don't accept the invitation to hold a press conference	Reschedule the press conference to have more time to convince experts that your fracking operation was not the cause of the pollution.	Your company has been invited to hold a press conference to disclose controversy about chemicals involved with hydraulic fracking. Statements of environmental detriment caused by your company's implementation are further circulating around the wells that you own.
5	Launch a PR campaign outlining the economic benefits of fracking in Delaware	Hire lawyers and craft a legal agreement that will force residents to lease their lands to your fracking company	Build your fracking sites anyway and deal with the residents later	Your researchers found out that there is a large shale basin in Delaware. You've asked the local residents to lease their land in exchange for a large amount of money. However, a great number of people refuse to leave their land despite being offered money to lease their lands. If this shale basin is acquired you'll be the first fracking company to establish a site in Delaware and this will reflect the span of your fracking site company
6	Pay the fine	Contend that it is not your company's fault	Call your lawyers and researchers and prove that the creek was already contaminated even before you had your fracking site in the area	Local residents presented credible evidence that your company was responsible for the contamination of the creek near your fracking site. Now the judge is ordering you to pay $371,000 to the local government as compensation for the contamination of water and death of over one hundred wild life species living near the creek. 
7	File a lawsuit indicating that Dr. Jane Doe have no right in accessing confidential documents from any company	Hire investigators to investigate the questionable credibility and reputation of Dr. Jane Doe	Ask producers of the interview to postpone their interview because Dr. Jane	Dr. Jane Doe has been observing and gathering data from fracking sites. She found out that there are over 596 harmful chemicals found in fracking liquids. In her upcoming interview, she will give a detail review on the chemicals used in fracking. She'll also release her studies on the effects of chemicals on the environment, animals, and people. The interview will be watched by over 2 million audience memebers.
8	Hire the best lawyers in the country	Hire scientists and contend that hydraulic fracturing do not harm the environment 	Let the trial play out and just pay the fines.	A coalition of environmentalists, nature advocates, and local residents expressed great concerns on the unregulated hydraulic fracturing methods of some of the major natural gas companies. The case has been brought up to the higher courts and all the natural gas companies including your company has been called to testify in front of an investigation committee.
9	Send comapany investigation unit to determine that the cause of water quality.	Pay local news stations to not allow stories to appear on mainstream media	Argue that their water had been contaminated even before fracking sites were established in the area.	Different footage of Wyoming residents showing that their tap water lights up on fire. Many were proposing the idea that their groundwater supply had been contaminated by the frackers near the area. Your company has a fracking site in Wyoming and you might be in jeopardy because these videos are all over the local news. 
10	Issue a statement of apology acknowledging the harmful effects of your fracking operations	Launch a campaign for the rehabilitation and repopulation of antelope and deers in the area	Have a meeting with the people and the local wildlife preserve and contend that it wasn't your fracking infrastructure that caused it. It was in fact the other nearby fracking site who dealt with a similar case from last year. 	Hundreds of antelopes and deers living near your frack sites has been found dead. This incidence caught the attention of the local wildlife preserve and is now attempting to halt you fracking operations. Local residences near the area shows solidarity behind the proposal released by the local wildlife preserve. Some residents speak out against your company saying that your fracking infrastructures and chemical emissions are not only affecting their families but also the wild life around them.
11	Withdraw your application for extending exploration and plan on submitting one in the future. [delays cause increase in fracking costs and embolden protests]	Lobby the national energy secretary to claim that "Fracking is not evil", and it can be done safely and cheaply. [future regulations may be easier to lobby, but protests may swing the state/country the other way]	Withdraw application and lobby the national energy secretary to claim that "Fracking is not evil", and it can be done safely and cheaply. [future regulations may be easier to lobby]	Anti-fracking activists have staged a series of protests at various sites over the past weeks. You have a permit to explore in the area but worried it may be too controversial to continue
12	immediately shut in all wells in area and state	 call for an investigation but use lawyers to delay findings	 blame housing developers and lobby heavily to keep regulation from increasing	An explosion at a home in Colorado, which killed two people and prompted the state's biggest oil producer to shut down some of its wells, has highlighted the tension between Colorado's flourishing oil business and its rapid housing development.
13	Use this news as PR material and let fracking opponents know about the benefits of fracking for the economy	Call the media for an interview to highlight the significance of fracking to the economy	Pay local newspapers to make this news as their headline	An online news report concludes that ever since the shale oil boom in 2008, increased production of gasoline led to a decline in oil prices. In 2008, the U.S. economy paid $390 billion for crude oil and finished product imports. However, in 2016, the U.S. paid $78 billion - a difference of $312 billion
14	Ignore	Try to resovle water quality	Buy out ownership of wells and compensate land owners	Pennsylvania has shown elevated levels of methane in wells located near less than  1 kilometer ( about 0.621371 mile) of shale gas drilling sites vs. wells located more than 1 kilometer from those areas, which had lower concentration of methane
15	Change old extraction method and use more sustainable alternative - costs of drilling goes way up, but environmental damage goes down	Ignore ( if its not broke why fix it ?) - risks increasing regulation	Claim to use this technology but continue to use original methods	New Fracking technology now does not require water
16	. Celebrate this study as proof that fracking does not affect groundwater. [1 PR point; increase chance of later environment/contamination effects; reduce chance of being sued]	Work to reduce the number of spills that affect surface water [1 Research point; increase regulation/costs in state; decrease environment/contam chance in state]	Do nothing [increase chance of later environment/contamination effects]	nternational Journal publishes study that hydraulic fracturing affects surface water in W.Va streams but not groundwater. Spill water from fracked wells was affecting the quality of streams in areas with significant shale gas development, because of the frequency of spills.
17	Abide by regulations	Falsify data, pay out an EPA Representative	Invest more money in eco-technology to capture emissions more effectively	EPA  regulations would actually save companies money in the long run, the EPA estimates, since companies could sell the methane and other compounds they capture, which would more than pay for the new equipment
