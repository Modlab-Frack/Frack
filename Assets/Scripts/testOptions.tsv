1	Hire scientists at near university to produce false data about emissions.	Keep calm and DO Nothing	Set up meeting with head investigator to talk out "issues in record emissions"	Environmental Working Group (EWG) has decided to investigate the credibility of EPA record of emissions from Fracking wells in Texas. (You happen to also own 75 of the wells in the state.)
2	Remove all carcinogenic ingredients	Refuse to disclose ingredients and health hazards associated with those chemicals	Replace that one ingredient brought up	The use of dimethyl formaldehyde listed as a constituent of fracking fluid has raised health concerns. This ingredient has not only been known as an irritant to skin and eyes, but has been found in ground water. Long term effects include failure kidneys and liver.
3	Invest on research to effectively seal any leakage coming from fracking sites	Propose a hefty settlement to those who are affected	Close down your fracking operations in the area but don't mention you are responsible for the environmental effects. 	Hazardous, carcinogenic and non-biodegradable materials are used by your company's drilling process for natural gas. Knowingly, your extraction methods do not fully prevent natural gas from seeping out through the earth's surface and or under and through ground water layer. This has been proven on numerous accounts of residents who live in close proximity to your fracking wells in several states and more than 80 of them are experiencing degraded air quality and obvious signs of water pollution.
4	Give a general statement saying that your fracking operations doesn't use any harmful chemicals for extractions	Don't accept the invitation to hold a press conference	Reschedule the press conference to have more time to convince experts that your fracking operation was not the cause of the pollution.	Your company has been invited to hold a press conference to disclose controversy about chemicals involved with hydraulic fracking. Statements of environmental detriment caused by your company's implementation are further circulating around the wells that you own.
