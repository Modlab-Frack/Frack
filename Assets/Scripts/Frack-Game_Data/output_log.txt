Environmental Working Group (EWG) has decided to investigate the credibility of EPA record of emissions from Fracking wells in Texas. (You happen to also own 75 of the wells in the state.)

The use of dimethyl formaldehyde listed as a constituent of fracking fluid has raised health concerns. This ingredient has not only been known as an irritant to skin and eyes, but has been found in ground water. Long term effects include failure kidneys and liver.

Hazardous, carcinogenic and non-biodegradable materials are used by your company's drilling process for natural gas. Knowingly, your extraction methods do not fully prevent natural gas from seeping out through the earth's surface and or under and through ground water layer. This has been proven on numerous accounts of residents who live in close proximity to your fracking wells in several states and more than 80 of them are experiencing degraded air quality and obvious signs of water pollution.
 
(Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/generated/common/runtime/DebugBindings.gen.cpp Line: 51)

Your company has been invited to hold a press conference to disclose controversy about chemicals involved with hydraulic fracking. Statements of environmental detriment caused by your company's implementation are further circulating around the wells that you own.
